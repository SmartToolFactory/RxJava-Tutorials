/**
 * ðŸ”¥ INFO concatMap
 *
 * Just as there is **flatMap()**, which dynamically merges Observables derived off each emission,
 * there is a concatenation counterpart called concatMap().
 * You should prefer this operator **if you care about ordering** and want each **Observable mapped**
 * **from each emission to finish before starting the next one**.
 *
 * **concatMap()** will merge each mapped Observable sequentially and fire it one at a time.
 * It will **only move to the next** Observable when the current one calls **onComplete()**. If source emissions produce Observables faster than concatMap() can emit from them, those Observables will be queued.
