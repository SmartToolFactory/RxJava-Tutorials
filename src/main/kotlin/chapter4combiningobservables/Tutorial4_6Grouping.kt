 * The GroupBy operator divides an Observable that emits items into an
 * Observable that emits Observables, each one of which emits some subset
 * of the items from the original source Observable.
 * Which items end up on which Observable is typically decided by a
 * discriminating function that evaluates each item and assigns it a key.
 * All items with the same key are emitted by the same Observable.

        common-key emissions (since this will return a Single, we will need to use
