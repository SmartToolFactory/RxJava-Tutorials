 * This operator does not affect the operation or transform the emissions in any way.
 *
 * We just create a side-effect for each event that occurs at that point in the chain.
 * For instance, we can perform an action with each string before it is mapped to its length.
 * In this case, we will just print them by providing a **Consumer<T>** lambda:
