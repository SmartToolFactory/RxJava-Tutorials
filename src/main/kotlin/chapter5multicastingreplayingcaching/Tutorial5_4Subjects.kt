         When you run this code, you will see that after 2 seconds,

         Then, it will receive live emissions from that point on.
         But there is one important property of UnicastSubject; it will only work with
         one Observer and will throw an error for any subsequent ones.
         Logically, this makes sense because it is designed to release buffered emissions
         from its internal queue once it gets an Observer. But when these cached emissions are released,
         they cannot be released again to a second Observer since they are already gone.

          If you want a second Observer to receive missed emissions, you might as well use ReplaySubject.

          and consequently frees the memory used for that buffer, once it gets an Observer.
